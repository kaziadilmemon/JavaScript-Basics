// Strings are used to store and mnaipulate text.
let name="Harry"
// We can Write Strings as in single quoted as let name='harry'

/*                     Template Literals
Template Literals are use backtics instead of quotes to define.*/
let name1="Adil"
let name2="Asim"
// now we can print like Adil is a friend of Asim
let sentence=`${name1} is a friend of ${name2}`
console.log(sentence)

 // We can insert variables directly in template literals This is called String interpolation.


//      Escape Sequence:
  let fruit='Bana\'na'
console.log(fruit.length)
// We have other Escape Sequence too which we can use there like  \n=newline , \t=Tab , \r=Carriage Return
